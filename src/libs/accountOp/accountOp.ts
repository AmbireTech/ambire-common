 * ethers.toUtf8Bytes to it, completing ignoring that the string
 * might actually be abi-encoded (like in our case).
 *
 * Applying ethers.toUtf8Bytes to a string is only correct if the
 * string is... a utf8 string. In our case, IT IS NOT.
 * That's why we need to wrap in with ethers.getBytes to prevent
 * the sign message from breaking it.
 *
 * If despite everything you wish to return a string instead of a Uint8Array,
 * you have to wrap the hash with ethers.getBytes each time before passing it
 * to signMessage. Also, the reverse method of ethers.getBytes is ethers.hexlify
 * if you need to transform it back.
