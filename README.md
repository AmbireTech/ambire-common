# Common ground for the Ambire apps

This package puts together the core business logic behind the Ambire browser extensions and (the future) mobile apps.

## Install

This package is not intended to run standalone.

Itâ€™s meant to be used as a dependency by Ambire apps.

You may install it standalone only for development purposes â€” e.g. to run tests, make changes, or compile it locally:

```bash
npm install
```

## Environment Variables

Create ".env" file in the root directory and fill in all variables, see ".env-sample" for a reference.

## Branching & Git Flow

We follow a lightweight Git branching model:

- **v1** (legacy)

  - `v1` branch (ex `master` branch), now archived as the final state of the v1 codebase. Ambire v1 apps are in maintenance mode, so occasionally small changes may be applied to this branch.
  - `develop` branch - deprecated and deleted; used in the past for v1 development

- **v2** (current)

  - `v2` branch is our active development branch
  - `main` branch - reflects the current production version, all releases are merged here

## Compiling

### JS and TS

This package **does not** include compiled **JS and TS** output in the repository.

Each Ambire app compiles it individually as needed.

The dist/ folder exists for internal use only. It may contain some compiled files, but it is not kept up to date and not updated on release.

Do not rely on dist/ as a source of compiled code.

Example on how to manually compile a file to the dist/ folder:

```bash
tsc src/libs/portfolio/getOnchainBalances.ts \
  --target es2020 \
  --module commonjs \
  --esModuleInterop true \
  --sourceMap true \
  --resolveJsonModule true \
  --outDir ./dist
```

### Contracts

This package contains all of the contracts that are used within ambire-common, as well as contracts that are used in projects that have ambire-common as dependency. Do not delete compiled contracts unless you are sure they are not used in the Ambire web wallet, mobile wallet and relayer.

To compile specific set of contracts, simply list the **contract names** in the command `compile:contracts` like so:

```bash
npm run compile:contracts WALLETSupplyController LegendsNFTImplementation
```

## Rules

Always commit in ambire-common code that's compatible with web & mobile both ðŸ¤ž

## Editor Config

Make sure your code editor has plugins that support the following configuration files: `.editorconfig`, `.prettierrc`, `tsconfig.json`, `eslintrc.js`, [`import-sorter.json`](https://github.com/SoominHan/import-sorter).
