# Common ground for the Ambire apps

This package puts together the core business logic behind Ambire web and mobile apps.

## Install

```bash
yarn install
```

## Development Workflow

### Option 1: clone ambire-common in parent's node_modules

After cloning the web or the mobile app and doing `npm install` (or `yarn install`), delete the `node_modules/ambire-common` directory and git clone the ambire-common (this) repository into `node_modules/ambire-common` instead.

### Option 2: use `npm link` (for the web app only)

1. Run `yarn install:peers` in ambire-common.

2. In the ambire-common directory run `npm link`

3. In the web app (ambire-wallet) directory, run `npm link ambire-common`.

Note: After every `npm install` in the web app (ambire-wallet) directory, linking gets lost. You need to perform step 3 again.

## Release workflow

## Workflow

1. Release cycle: every Monday.

1. When a change is needed, if you need it fast (hot), PR against `main`

1. When a change is needed, if you can wait until Monday - PR against `develop`

1. If needed, introduce a release branch (example: `release/0.16.0`). Merge multiple changes needed for the web or mobile apps QA in there.

1. When a new version for ambire-common is needed, create a new git tag, issue a new [release](https://github.com/AmbireTech/ambire-common/releases) and describe what has changed. Follow semantic versioning when choosing a tag name.

## Rules

Always commit in ambire-common code that's compatible with web & mobile both ðŸ¤ž

## Tips

Tip during development: When updating the ambire-common version in the web app `package.json`, do not manually change your `package.json` and run `npm install`. Instead, execute `npm install "github:AmbireTech/ambire-common#v0.11.0"`. Otherwise, for some reason, package-lock file don't update accordingly and they persist refs to the previous ambire-common version. The issue either comes from npm instelf, or for something really specific in web's package-lock file.

Tip for hotfixes: In case you immediately need the change on PROD, you can simply (temporarily) ref in app's `package.json` instead a tag (`"ambire-common": "github:AmbireTech/ambire-common#v0.11.2"`) a specific commit SHA (`"ambire-common": "github:AmbireTech/ambire-common#2e8639e004044bda3fe7efa3290672d63bfe5f8a"`).

## Editor Config

Make sure your code editor has plugins that support the following configuration files: `.editorconfig`, `.prettierrc`, `tsconfig.json`, `eslintrc.js`, [`import-sorter.json`](https://github.com/SoominHan/import-sorter).
