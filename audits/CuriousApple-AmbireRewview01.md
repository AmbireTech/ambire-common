# About 

## [Ambire](https://www.ambire.com/)
Ambire is one of the pioneers of smart contract wallets, with version 1 launched in late 2021. 
This particular update, version 2, focuses on their implementation of EIP4337, Paymaster, and a novel recovery scheme, DKIM. 
The DKIM recovery system allows users to perform self-custodial email/password authentication on-chain and recover their wallet.</br> 
More details about DKIM recovery can be found [here](https://ambire.notion.site/Ambire-self-custodial-email-password-authentication-via-DKIM-324a57312b3e4fe7b66935318cbea435)

# Detailed Findings

## [C-01] Anyone can take control of someone's wallet by encoding the from address inside the subject

**Impact: High** </br>
**Likelihood: High**

Ambire allows users to recover their wallets using DKIM signatures if the DKIM signature is done on headers equal to what the user has specified in their account info. 
However, due to a flaw in the parsing logic of [`_verifyHeaders`](https://github.com/AmbireTech/ambire-common/blob/f411456c06a409bbcbbee0c12c7496916202860b/contracts/DKIMRecoverySigValidator.sol#L398-L399), anyone can spoof the `emailFrom` address and take control of the wallet.

Let's take the following header as an example:

```solidity
to: adamcrein@gmail.com
subject: Give permissions to 0x70997970c51812dc3a010c7d01b50e0d17dc79c8 SigMode 0
message-id: <CAKXuq_X92FgFsmP_jvEyeTJDprj9_QG_fV=K4F3DWK50-gGQ0g@mail.gmail.com>
date: Mon, 21 Aug 2023 05:01:56 +0300
from: test testov <alice@gmail.com>

```

While verifying headers, Ambire's current logic is as follows:

- The "to" header should **start** with "emailTo" (`startsWith`).
- The "subject" header should **contain** the string "subject:Give..." (`split`).
- The "from" header should **contain** "emailFrom" after "from:" (`find`).

All of these checks are performed from **top to bottom, left to right**.

Now, to gain control of Alice's wallet, what if I pass the following subject:

```solidity
to: adamcrein@gmail.com
subject: **from:test testov <alice@gmail.com> subject:Give permissions to 0x70997970c51812dc3a010c7d01b50e0d17dc79c8 SigMode 0**
message-id: <CAKXuq_X92FgFsmP_jvEyeTJDprj9_QG_fV=K4F3DWK50-gGQ0g@mail.gmail.com>
date: Mon, 21 Aug 2023 05:01:56 +0300
from: mr.robot <attack@gmail.com>

```

The subject will be identified as "subject:Give permissions to 0x70997970c51812dc3a010c7d01b50e0d17dc79c8 SigMode 0" since it exists as expected by the `verifyHeaders` logic. 
Ambire's `verifyHeaders` will start from the top and identify the "from" as the one I spoofed in the subject ([alice@gmail.com](mailto:alice@gmail.com)) and not the actual one ([attack@gmail.com](mailto:attack@gmail.com)) since the search stops at the first find. 
This would basically allow someone to gain access to user wallets for matching selectors and all user wallets who accept unknown selectors.

### Recommendation

Consider correcting the parsing logic so that it is independent of user-dependent fields.

### Status

[Fixed](https://github.com/AmbireTech/ambire-common/pull/400)

## [M-01] Users can replay Ambire's paymaster signatures and make Ambire pay more than intended if `Entrypoint` is changed

**Impact: Medium** </br>
**Likelihood: Medium**

`Entrypoints` can change and each one has its own nonce management. 
Now the question is, if the `entrypoint` is changed from A to B, can a transaction that was already executed using A for nonce N1 be replayed on B?

`Entrypoint` resolves this attack vector by encoding the `entrypoint` address to the `userOp` hash.</br> 
[`getUserOpHash`](https://github.com/eth-infinitism/account-abstraction/blob/73a676999999843f5086ee546e192cbef25c0c4a/contracts/core/EntryPoint.sol#L298`)

The vulnerable case in Ambireâ€™s scenario is `validatePaymasterUserOp`.</br>

Ambire's `validatePaymasterUserOp` ignores the passed `userOphash` from the `entrypoint` and derives its own hash, due to cyclic dependency.</br>

### Recommendation

Consider adding `entrypoint` to the signed digest of `validatePaymasterUserOp`

### Recommendation
Consider replacing the old nomenclature of "Identity" with "AmbireAccount".

### Status
[Fixed](https://github.com/AmbireTech/ambire-common/commit/40812f241c38f8db859d8769b9b1fd16541869d2)

## Informationals 

1. Any call made to `AmbireAccount` will be successful if `fallbackHandler == address(0)`. </br>
2. Since `chain.id` is not included in external signatures (DKIM), a DKIM recovery on one chain of a wallet could be executed on another chain by anyone. </br>
3. Low-level calls will return success for all cases if `to` is not a contract.</br>
4. Once given DKIM key is disabled it can not be used again since `key.isExisting` persists.
5. There is no guarantee that all `ExecuteArgs` of `executeMultiple()` would be executed at once only. 
Since the signature verification is done on individual set of `toExec.calls`, anyone can call `execute()` directly and execute individual actions if the nonce is in sync.</br>
For example, let's consider Alice calls `executeMultipleâ‡’[Set A, Set B]`.</br> 
Anyone can execute actions of set A without executing actions from set B. 
Once the nonce is incremented by another action, the same applies to set B.
