## Contest scope

All the contracts in `contracts/`, namely `AmbireAccount.sol`, `libs/SignatureValidator.sol`, `libs/Bytes.sol`, `AmbireAccountFactory.sol`, a total of 476 LoC.

## Architecture

Ambire is a smart contract wallet a.k.a account abstraction wallet. Each user is represented by a smart contract, which is a minimal proxy (EIP 1167) for `AmbireAccount.sol` ([example](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x7ce38c302924f4b84a2c3a158df7ca9a5b7d1e1e#code)) - we call "account". Many addresses can control each account - we call this "privileges" in the contract and "authorities" in the UI.

The main contract everything is centered around is `AmbireAccount.sol`, which is the actual smart wallet.

Accounts can execute multiple calls in the same on-chain transaction. We call the array of user transactions a "user bundle" - the user signs the hash of this array along with anti-replay data such as nonce, chainID and others. Once it's signed, anyone can execute it by calling `AmbireAccount(account).execute`

The addresses that control an account (privileges) can be EOAs but they can also be smart contracts themselves, thanks to the `SmartWallet` signature mode in `SignatureValidator` which enables EIP 1271 signatures to be used.

To allow more sophisticated authentication schemes without upgradability, we use a very simple relationship: a periphery contract that only deals with the specific authentication scheme can be added to `privileges`. For example, if a user wants to convert their account to a multisig, they can remove all other privileges and only authorize a single one: a multisig manager contract, that will verify N/M signatures and call `AmbireAccount(account).executeBySender` upon successful verification. This also works for EIP 1271 signatures since `AmbireAccount.isValidSignature` uses `SignatureValidator`, which supports EIP 1271 itself, so it will propagate the call down to the multisig manager contract.

This very system is used by `QuickAccManager`, which is a simple 2/2 multisig, that also allows 1/2 transactions but with a timelock. This is used to allow for simple email/password login that can be upgraded by either backing up the second key or by moving to a hardware wallet. For more info on this authentication scheme please read the [security model Gist](https://gist.github.com/Ivshti/fe86f13c3adff3404a1f5ce1e364304c).

There are two ways for a user bundle to get executed:

- Directly, when a user's EOA pays for gas
- Through a Relayer that takes the signed message that authorizes a user bundle, and broadcasts it itself, paying for gas. The user bundle will have to contain an ERC-20 transaction that pays the Relayer to reimburse it for gas. Currently we have a proprietary relayer that does all of this.

The actual proxy for each account is deployed counterfactually, when the first user bundle is executed.

Because user bundles are authorized as signed messages, there's no need for hardware wallets to support EIP 1559 directly.

Similar products include Argent, Gnosis Safe and Authereum. The most notable differences is that the Ambire contracts are designed to be as simple as possible, and prefer composability to upgradability and built-in modularity.

### Testing and JS libs

The contracts in scope can also be found in this repo: https://github.com/AmbireTech/adex-protocol-eth/tree/identity-v5.2, specifically the identity-v5.2 branch (NOTE: we only care about the contracts in scope!).

The code is frozen for review on commit 742e800c5a6aabe08c59625f3dfd85139223ee63.

In the repo, there are also tests that can be ran, namely `test/TestAmbireAccount.js`. Other pieces of code you need to know about are `js/Bundle.js`, responsible for preparing and signing user bundles, and `js/AmbireAccountProxyDeploy.js`, responsible for deploying the minimal proxies.

**NOTE**: The UI is currently in private beta, but you can use the [factory contract](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x447f228e6af15c2df147235ecb9abe53bd1f46ad#code) and [AmbireAccount.sol](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xa2e9e41ee85ae792a8213736c7f9398a933f8184) to experiment on Polygon mainnet.

### Design decisions

The contracts are free of inheritance and external dependencies.

There is no code upgradability and no ownership (`onlyOwner`) or pausability, to ensure immutability. For easier readability, there are no modifiers, while keeping the code DRY.

Storage usage is cut down to the minimum: when bigger data structures need to be saved, we take advantage of the cheap calldata and always pass them in, verifying the hash against a storage slot in the process, for example `QuickAccManager` uses this for quick accounts.

## Smart contract summary

### AmbireAccount.sol

The core of the Ambire smart wallet. Each user is a minimal proxy with this contract as a base. It contains very few methods, with the most notable being:

- `execute`: executes a signed user bundle
- `executeBySender`: executes a bundle as long as `msg.sender` is authorized

There's a few methods that can only be called by the AmbireAccount itself, which means the only way to call them is through a call through `execute`/`executeBySender`, ensuring it's authorized. Those methods are `setAddrPrivilege`, `tipMiner` and `tryCatch`.

It's only dependency is an internal one, `SignatureValidator`.

### SignatureValidator.sol

Validates signatures in a few modes: EIP-712, EthSign, SmartWallet and Spoof. The first two verify signed messages using `ecrecover`, the only difference being that EthSign expects the "Ethereum signed message:" prefix. SmartWallet is for ERC-1271 signatures (smart contract signatures), and Spoof is for spoofed signatures that only work when `tx.origin == address(1)`.

### AmbireAccountFactory.sol

A simple CREATE2 factory contract designed to deploy minimal proxies for users. The most notable point here is `deploySafe`, which is a method that protects us from griefing conditions: `CREATE2` will fail if a contract has already been deployed, and this method essentially ensures a contract is deployed without failing if it already is.

The use case of this is counterfactual deployment: the proxy of each account will be deployed when the first user bundle is executed, but we don't want to fail the whole bundle in case the contract has already been deployed.

There is a method to drain the contract of ERC-20 tokens.

### wallet/QuickAccManager.sol

This contract facilitates a 2/2 multisig scheme described in the aforementioned security model document.

It has a set of methods for sending, scheduling and cancelling user bundles:

- `send`: will execute a bundle immediately if it has 2/2 signatures, or schedule it if it's 1/2
- `cancel`: will cancel any pending bundle
- `execScheduled`: will execute a matured scheduled bundle as long as the QuickAcc is still authorized on the `AmbireAccount`

And two EIP-712 methods: `sendTransfer` and `sendTxns`, which only allow 2/2 signatures, but support typed data signatures.

## Known tradeoffs

**NOTE**: "bundle"/"user bundle" in this context means array of AmbireAccount-level transactions (`AmbireAccount.Transaction[]`)

- **Account recovery security model**: QuickAccManager allows users to control their wallets through a 2/2 multisig (see [security model](https://gist.github.com/Ivshti/fe86f13c3adff3404a1f5ce1e364304c)), with one of the keys in their own custody and the other key on the Ambire Relayer, with a possibility of the user backing it up. Timelocked transactions can be sent or cancelled by only 1/2 keys. This means that if the Ambire key is compromised AND lost, the attacker can cause grief by cancelling every attempt of the user to recover their funds. This can be avoided if the user backs up their key, which we recommend anyway for guaranteed full custody.
- **Storing additional data in `privileges`:** instead of boolean values, we use `bytes32` for the `privileges` mapping and treat any nonzero value as `true`. This is because we utilize the storage space for periphery contracts such as `QuickAccManager` or a planned `MultiSigManager` in the future. Utilizing a storage slot has the same gas costs no matter if `true` or hash is stored.
- **ERC-4337 support left for a later stage:** while we do have ERC-4337 support [implemented](https://github.com/AmbireTech/wallet/blob/v2-improvements/contracts/ERC4337Manager.sol), we are choosing not to include it in the scope so as to keep things simple for the intial launch, which will use our own relayer instead of ERC-4337 anyway
- **ERC-20 fees taken through the transaction batch:** there's no special mechanism for reimbursing the relayer for the gas fee. Instead, the relayer looks at the bundle (`Transactions[]`) and sees if one or more of those transactions are ERC-20 `transfer`s that send tokens to it. The relayer is responsible for checking whether the fee token and amount is acceptable for it, as well as checking it the transaction will execute before broadcasting it to the mempool. This is also a tradeoff cause the internal transactions may fail, in which case the whole bundle reverts and the fee is not paid, but the relayer will pay for gas. This is worked around on the Relayer end by utilizing Flashbots and Eden to avoid mining failing transactions, and by simulating the transactions right before trying to mine them. The reason we don't try/catch the errors int he `AmbireAccount` is because we want user bundles to succeed/fail as a whole (atomically), and the transaction to show as failing on Etherscan.
- **Signature spoof mode:** the `SignatureValidator.sol` contract has a mode which allows signatures to be spoofed. The purpose of this is to allow easier simulation through `eth_call` and `eth_estimateGas` before having a signature from the user, since without this we would have a cyclical dependency that takes two steps to resolve (fee is unknown, user signs once to estimate the fee, then user signs a second time cause the bundle changed). This spoofing should not be allowed when calling through anywhere else other than `AmbireAccount(account).execute`, and it only works if `tx.origin == address(1)`.
- **Signature validation before deployment:** due to the nature of EIP 1271, signatures cannot be validated before the user account is deployed. In Ambire, the user account (proxy) is deployed when the user performs their first transaction.

## How to run the tests
